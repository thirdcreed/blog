###What is this?
A blog. A place to archive thoughts - not all mine - that have become big enough that I can't keep them straight without writing them down.  It's a place for me to prove to myself that I'm thinking clearly about very complex issues.  Many of these thoughts describe the structures we create when we try to comprehend reality, and the problems we run into when we rely too heavily on these abstractions.  I'm sure it will prominently feature the subject of emergence, and its effects on knowledge, art, music, politics, religion, tech and other human activities, some more mundane.  I will publish a new article essentially when I feel like it, but I will try to make it regular.


###Who Am I?
My name is Caleb. I'm married and have a two-year old son.  I work as a software developer and I like my job, before I was writing software, I was teaching kids music, at an elementary school.  I enjoy philosophizing, but I have no professional qualifications, and I do not have any kind of authority.  You'll have to take the thoughts as they are.  There are people who have thought more, and better, about all of this, and find what I think is revelatory -- obvious.  I have things to say, that are worth saying, but I appreciate that I am an amateur, and that I have not invested as many years into these subjects as many others.

###Why is it called wrong?
Our abstractions are all leaky, our models of the universe require daily amendments, we're always misunderstanding everything in some important way.  This blog is the log of a pursuit of mental models that map as closely as possible to reality.
